  <h1>Hello everyone!</h1>

<body>
  <p> This is <strong>Uzair.</strong>
    I started coding about 2 months ago. At first,
    I wanted to become a cyberscurity expert and also I wanted to learn about iOS app developing ; I think cybersecurity and coding might not sound related to oneanother,
    but I didn't knew what to start with so, I started searching online and I learnd that the coding language for iOS is Swift. At the time I didn't had a macbook and my existing laptop was an hp with only 4gigs of RAM and 64GB SSD. So I had no chance to start learning Swift.
    </p>
    <p>I started taking classes online ie: watching videos and  I found out about these websites called <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/" target="_blank"/>SOLOLEARN AND <a href="https://freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank"/> Which are both excellent and free.<br />
    BTW 
    <ol> Some great YouTube channels to learn from;
      <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NetworkChuck" > NetworkChuck </a></li>
      <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCoderCoder" > Codercoder </a></li>
      <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Cyberspatial" > Cyberspacial </a> </li>
          </ol></p>
    <p>
      After finding about these, I started learning HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and at the time I didn't even knew which programming language I was learning. I finished HTML quite easily and continued learning CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) a bit till I realised that I didn't need those for iOS app developing.
      So I lost interest and stopped learning for some time.
      By the way HTML is for webcontent, and CSS is for webdesign. As far as I know :)
