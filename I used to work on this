    <p allign="center">From a coder newbie!! </p>
    <p> Hi my name is <strong>Uzair.</strong>
    I started coding about 3 months ago. At first,
    I wanted to become a cyberscurity expert and also I wanted to learn about iOS app developing ; I know cyberscurity and coding might not sound related to oneanother.
    But I didn't knew what to start with so, I started searching online and I learnd that the coding language for iOS is Swift.
    </p>

    <p> So, I started taking classes online ie: watching videos and  I found out about these website called SOLOLEARN AND <FREECODECAMP class="ORG">FREECODECAMP</FREECODECAMP> Which are both excellent and free.
   
       <ol> Some great YouTube channels to learn from :
    <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NetworkChuck" > NetworkChuck </a></li>
    <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCoderCoder" > Codercoder </a></li>
    <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Cyberspatial" > Cyberspacial </a> </li>
        </ol></p>
        </p>   
    Then I started learning HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and at the I didn't even knew which programming language I was learning. I finished HTML quite easily and continued learning CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) a bit till I realised that I didn't need those for iOS app developing.
    So I stoped learning for some time. And I was waiting for my brother to get me a macbook as it is better to learn iOS app developing on a macbook than a windows pc.
    By the way HTML is for webcontent, and CSS is for webdesign. As far as I know :)
